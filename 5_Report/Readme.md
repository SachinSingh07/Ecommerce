# UML DIAGRAMS #
----------------------------------------------------------

The elements are like components which can be associated in different ways to make a complete UML picture, which is known as diagram. Thus, it is very important to understand the different diagrams to implement the knowledge in real-life systems.

There are two broad categories of diagrams and they are again divided into subcategories ‚àí

- Structural Diagrams

- Behavioral Diagrams

## Structural Diagrams ##

The structural diagrams represent the static aspect of the system. These static aspects represent those parts of a diagram, which forms the main structure and are therefore stable.
